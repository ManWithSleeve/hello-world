Hello, World
============

Traditional first project. [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=ManWithSleeve/hello-world)

Man with Sleeve -- it's an ace painting by Titian. It hangs in the National Gallery in London. The usual name is something like "A Man with a Quilted Sleeve." You can read all about the painting on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_with_a_Quilted_Sleeve

Man with Sleeve is nothing to do with tattoos, despite what Pinterest might say.
