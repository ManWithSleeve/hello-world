Hello, World
============

Traditional first project.

Man with Sleeve -- it's ace painting by Titian. It hangs in the National Gallery in London. The usual name is some like "A Man with a Quilted Sleeve." You can read all about the painting on twitter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_with_a_Quilted_Sleeve

Man with Sleeve is nothing to do with tattoos, despite what Pinterest might say.
